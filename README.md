    * Can I have a list of contacts to add (both TCKs and everyone else you want on there)?
* **In progress 2022-07-05**: Raffles page
    * Somewhat added; could be prettier but it works decently now
    * Items are read from the database automatically
    * Still needs special text for when there's no raffle/giveaway items available
    * Functionality (entering raffles/giveaways) still needs to be implemented
* Get videos from channels to display on the videos page
    * The backend code is written already, just not implemented
* Admin panel
* Actually add the affiliate links
    * If you could tell me what these are that would be ideal
* Add OpenGraph tags
* Add Google Analytics tags
* User settings page (ie to link Discord and see entered raffles)
